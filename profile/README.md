## About

WPI Roadmap provides an inituitive solution over the existing tracking sheets to help WPI students more easily understand their majors and course requirements. The website is designed to be easy to use and is great for students planning their academics by keeping track of their major requirements and progress as well as visualizing prerequisites and course offerings, integrating information from sources such as OSCAR and RateMyProfessor. This project was developed by Randy Huang, Tarun Eswar, Ajay Bhagavatula, Erica Dong, and Charles Tang for the GoatHacks 2024 hackathon at WPI.


## Current Features

- Roadmap visualization (basic hierarchies)
- Basic tracking sheet
- Sync with courselistings.wpi.edu for up-to-date course offerings and professor/course ratings
- Profiles

### Future Work

- Improvements towards current features: a more comprehensive roadmap, better tracking sheets, and full integration with data from sources like OSCAR and RateMyProfessors
- AI-integration, including but not limited to course recommendations based on your major, interests, and satisfaction with past courses
- Community features
- Let us know what you'd like to see in the feedback form below!

## Contributing

We'd love to have your help in making WPI Roadmap better. The project still has work to do before full production launch, but if there's an issue you'd like to see addressed sooner rather than later, feel free to provide feedback in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5q6dSj64dnJKFNRnLR2la4wynA2aWlHugiemjvx-f8ElQWg/viewform)!
